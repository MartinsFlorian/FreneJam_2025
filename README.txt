Modifiers:
- Extreme Input Lag : The game has a permanent 1 second lag to handle the inputs. The game should still be playable though.

- Prefabs Only : EVERY GameObject on the scenes should be a Prefab, with no local override. Those prefabs must be properly separated in terms of responsibility.

- Single Scene : make that game on only one scene and keep things organized on it.

How to play:
It's a endless Runner with Lag Input. You need to avoid obstacles and collect coins to gain score.
If you hit a obstacle or a wall you lose.
Controls: 
	Q/D to go Left/Right
